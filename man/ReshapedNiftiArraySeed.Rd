\usage{
ReshapedNiftiArraySeed(
  filepath,
  name = "image",
  header_name = "hdr",
  dim,
  type = NA,
  header = NULL,
  chunkdim = NULL
)

  type = NA,

  chunkdim = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filepath}{The path (as a single character string) to the NIfTI or HDF5
file where the dataset is located. If a path to the NIfTI is provided we call
\code{\link[RNifti:readNifti]{RNifti::readNifti()}} and \code{\link[=writeNiftiArray]{writeNiftiArray()}} to convert to the HDF5
and more memory and time are used. If a path to a HDF5 file the data is simply loaded
into R as an object of class \link{NiftiArray}. A path to the HDF5 file is more memory and time efficient.}

\item{name}{The name of the group for the NIfTI image in the HDF5 file. Default is set to "image".
Unless you have to other "image" groups in the HDF5 file there is no need to change default settings.}

\item{header_name}{The name of the group for the NIfTI header in the HDF5 file. Default is set to "header".
Unless you have to other "header" groups in the HDF5 file there is no need to change default settings.}

\item{dim}{A vector of dimensions that describes the virtual
reshaping i.e. the reshaping that is virtually applied upfront
to the HDF5 dataset when the ReshapedHDF5Array object gets constructed.
See \link[HDF5Array:ReshapedHDF5Array-class]{HDF5Array::ReshapedHDF5Array}.}

\item{type}{\code{NA} or the R atomic type, passed to
\code{\link[HDF5Array:HDF5Array-class]{HDF5Array::HDF5Array()}} corresponding to the type of the HDF5 dataset. Default is set to \code{NA}.
Unless you want different types of HDF5 storage files there is no need to change default settings.}

\item{header}{List of NIfTI header information to override call of
\link{nifti_header}.}

\item{chunkdim}{the reshaped dimensions of chunks.}

An object of class \code{ReshapedNiftiArraySeed}
